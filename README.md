# Virus simulation class project (on MITx)
In this class project, I designed and implemented a stochastic simulation of patient and virus population dynamics, and reach conclusions about treatment regimens based on the simulation results.

I implemented a few classes: SimpleVirus, Patient, ResistantVirus, TreatedPatint and two simulation methods (simulation without drugs and simulation with drug). They all interacted with one another. 

The Jupyter notebook file can be opened in the browser directly without any installation, the .py file will require an IDE (such as Spyder) to open.
